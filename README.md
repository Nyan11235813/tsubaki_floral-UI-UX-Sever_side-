üìå Setup Instructions
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

Web Server: Ensure you have a web server environment like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP installed, which includes Apache and MySQL.
Database Configuration:
Access your MySQL database (e.g., via phpMyAdmin).

Create a new database named tsubaki_floral.

Import the following SQL structure to create the products table (you might need to create this manually or from a .sql file if provided):

SQL

CREATE TABLE `products` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `description` text,
  `price` decimal(10,2) NOT NULL,
  `image_url` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
  `rating` decimal(2,1) DEFAULT '0.0',
  `reviews_count` int(11) DEFAULT '0',
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;
The db_connect.php file is configured to connect to localhost with root username and an empty password. If your database credentials are different, you will need to update db_connect.php:

        <?php
$servername = "localhost"; // Your database server name
$username = "root";       // Your database username
$password = "";           // Your database password
$dbname = "tsubaki_floral"; // Your database name

    // Create connection
    $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

    // Check connection
    if ($conn->connect_error) {
        die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
    }
    ?>
    ```
Place Files: Copy all project files (about.html, admin.php, contact.php, db_connect.php, index.php, login.php, logout.php, shop.php, assets/, images/ etc.) into your web server's document root (e.g., htdocs for XAMPP).
Access the Site: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost/your_project_folder_name/index.php.

üß†Usage
Browse the Shop: Navigate through the "Home" and "Shop" pages to see floral arrangements.

üìÑ Admin Access:
Go to http://localhost/your_project_folder_name/login.php to access the admin login page.
Use the following credentials to log in:
Username: admin
Password: password123
After logging in, you will be redirected to the admin.php page, where you can manage products.
To log out from the admin panel, click the "Logout" link.
